* A "read the file and display its contents, and use a specified UI toolkit" homework assignment that I agreed to "help a friend out with", and ended up doing in its entirety. My friend got full marks!
* Written in Java 8 using NetBeans and JavaFX, despite the fact I haven't done *any* appreciable Java coding since â€” maybe 2000?

## Introduction

"Help me with my homework, dude!" said my friend. He has a full-time job and a lot of other commitments on top of his Java course at a local community college...and it was Thanksgiving. There was no way he was going to get this done, and especially on Thanksgiving weekend.

The assignment:
> These assignments is required to use JavaFX, an input box for the file name,
> a submit button and the results from reading the file to be displayed in a
> pane below the input and button

That's an actual cut-and-paste of the assignment. Here's the text from the file:

> Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
> continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the
> proposition that all men are created equal Now we are engaged in
> a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so
> conceived and so dedicated can long endure We are met on a great
> battlefield of that war We have come to dedicate a portion of
> that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their
> lives that that nation might live

I'm a sucker for a hard-luck story, and I'd been meaning to dip my toe back into Java development after dropping it in favor of C# back during my [OpenCola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opencola_(company)) days. I was planning to take up Android development, anyway, so I figured that helping with the assignment would let me kill two birds with one stone:

* Help out my friend
* Get reacquainted with Java

This is the result of a couple of hours' work, which included grabbing NetBeans, finding out what JavaFX was, a little Googling on Java lists and file operations and JavaFX basics. The result compiles, works as expected, and my friend got full marks.
